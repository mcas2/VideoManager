# VideoManager
Welcome to my video managing application!
This is a full stack training project developed in Symfony and Angular, endorsed by a mySQL database. 

## Symfony
I set up a PHP skeleton with Symfony that works as a functional basic api. This api let the user manage a database with two tables: users and videos, that can be modified via HTTP requests.
This backend section works with Postman and other APIs platforms. Videos and users can be created, edited, deleted and listed.

## Angular
The Angular section of the project let the user utilise the api intuitively with graphic elements developed through Angular components. Thanks to the Angular tools the user can register and log in in a way we can manage.
